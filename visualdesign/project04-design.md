# Project 4 - Customized Website with a CSS Framework

Topic: Foods/Recipes

## Visual Design

### Layout

* Homepage: Z-pattern
  * ![project04-wireframe-home](/Users/ginaromanazzi/Documents/University of Rochester/6_Spring_2021/DMST290_Front End Web Design/project04_github/project04/visualdesign/project04-wireframe-home.JPG)
  * The Z-pattern is perfect for displaying large images - of food items or dishes - that will attract the reader's attention to learn more about delicious food. Especially useful is the call to action in the terminal area as an invitation to the reader and also as bait. Together with the images it will be easy to follow the appetite provoked by the images to the other pages.

* Content pages: F-pattern

  * The F-pattern fits well with this topic because we can include various aspects of the food like a recipe or background history. Depending on the user's needs, they might not want to read up on the history when looking for a recipe, but with the F-pattern they can scan the headings until they find what they are looking for. Also it is ideal to feed them more information than they want, such as advertising for kitchen gadgets or other recipes in the sidebar.

### Color Palette
The color palette is based on colors that are associated with food - a lot of greens and shades of red, some yellow:

### Typography

* Euphoria Script (cursive)    for headings/emphasis
* Quattrocento (serif)         for main text

Euphoria Script fits well with our chosen theme of food/dishes/recipes as it is a cursive handwritten font, reminding of handwritten recipes handed down from parents to children. It is more informal as kitchen matters are often personal. The strokes in this typeface are a little bit like squiggly spaghetti.

The typeface Quattrocento works well for the main text as it is more legible in great amounts than Euphoria Script. Going with the notion of handwritten recipes passed on from generation to generation, this typespace has an Old Style feeling, like recipes that have been in a family for years, maybe also typed on typewriter.
