* Recipes have steps

  * Roast

    * **Step 1**

      Season chuck roast with salt and black pepper; sear in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes per side.

    * **Step 2**

      Pour beef broth and water into the skillet with roast. Arrange onion wedges and garlic cloves around the meat. Spread carrots atop roast and place sprig of rosemary atop carrots. Turn heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 6 hours.

    * **Step 3**

      Cover potatoes with water in a large pot and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain. Mash potatoes with butter and half the evaporated milk until smooth; slowly mash remaining evaporated milk into potatoes to achieve the desired consistency. Season with salt.

    * **Step 4**

      Remove 1 or 2 cloves of garlic from skillet and mash cloves on top of the roast; serve with mashed potatoes.

  * Chicken & Dump

    * **Step 1**

      Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.

    * **Step 2**

      Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.

    * **Step 3**

      Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard bay leaf.

    * **Step 4**

      Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.

    * **Step 5**

      Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture is the texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside.

    * **Step 6**

      Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add peas and green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste. Select Saute function to bring broth back to a boil.

    * **Step 7**

      Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop the dumpling dough by heaping spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well.

    * **Step 8**

      Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should come out clean.

  * Mac & Cheese

    * **Step 1**

      Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

    * **Step 2**

      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.

    * **Step 3**

      Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.

    * **Step 4**

      Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.

    * **Step 5**

      Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.

    * **Step 6**

      Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.

    * **Step 7**

      Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.

  * Chicken Parm

    * **Step 1**

      Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

    * **Step 2**

      Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.

    * **Step 3**

      Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.

    * **Step 4**

      Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.

    * **Step 5**

      Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.

    * **Step 6**

      Dip flour coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to breadcrumb mixture, pressing the crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Set aside breaded chicken breasts for about 15 minutes.

    * **Step 7**

      Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.

    * **Step 8**

      Place chicken in a baking dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese on top and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.

    * **Step 9**

      Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

* Recipes have a description

  * Pot roast is a term used to describe a beef dish made by slow-cooking a usually tough cut of beef in moist heat, sometimes with vegetables. Tougher cuts such as chuck steak, bottom round, short ribs and 7-bone roast are preferred for this technique. These cuts are American terms, different terms and butchering styles are used throughout the Anglophone world and beyond. While the toughness of the fibers makes them unsuitable for oven roasting, slow cooking tenderizes the meat as the liquid exchanges some of its flavor with the beef.
  * Chicken and dumplings is a soup that consists of a chicken cooked in water, with the resulting chicken broth being used to cook the dumplings by boiling. A dumpling—in this context—is a biscuit dough, which is a mixture of flour, shortening, and liquid (water, milk, buttermilk, or chicken stock). The dumplings are either rolled out flat, dropped or formed into a ball. It is a popular comfort food dish, commonly found in the Southern and Midwestern United States, that is also attributed to being a French Canadian meal that originated during the Great Depression.
  * Macaroni and cheese (also called mac 'n' cheese in the United States, and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat. Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.
  * The dish, also known as "Chicken Parm", originated in the northeast United States from Italian immigrants, and became a popular staple in restaurants serving Italian-American cuisine by the 1950s. In the United States and Canada, chicken parmigiana is often served as a main course, and sometimes with a side of, or on top of pasta. Many restaurants also offer chicken parm sandwiches. Upon arriving in America, Italian immigrants began to take advantage of America's affordable meat market, incorporating chicken into parmigiana.
